**✅ Status**: Phase 3 (ML Training) is **COMPLETE and OPERATIONAL**

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Current Focus)

### 1. **Production Deployment (Phase 6-7)** 🎯

**Priority: HIGH - Current Focus**

**Goal**: Deploy the complete MLOps platform to AWS production environment

**Available Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Complete local development environment
- ✅ Streamlit web application ready for deployment
- ✅ Model registry with trained models (`monthly_win_probability_model`)
- ✅ Drift monitoring system operational
- ✅ All workflows orchestrated with Prefect
- ✅ Docker containers for all services

**Tasks:**
- [ ] 🎯 **AWS Infrastructure Setup**
  - Deploy to AWS using Terraform (infrastructure as code)
  - Set up AWS S3 for production artifact storage
  - Configure AWS RDS PostgreSQL for MLflow backend
  - Implement AWS ECS/Fargate for container orchestration
- [ ] 🎯 **Production CI/CD Pipeline**

  - Set up blue-green deployment for zero downtime
- [ ] 🎯 **Security & Monitoring**
  - Implement AWS IAM security policies
  - Set up CloudWatch for infrastructure monitoring
  - Configure alerts and notifications
- [ ] 🎯 **Performance Optimization**
  - Load testing and performance optimization
  - Auto-scaling configuration
  - Production-ready configuration tuning

**Files to create:**
```bash
infrastructure/                # 🎯 Infrastructure as Code
├── terraform/
│   ├── modules/              # Reusable Terraform modules
│   ├── environments/         # Dev/staging/prod configurations
│   └── shared/              # Shared resources
├── aws/
│   ├── ecs_tasks/           # ECS task definitions
│   ├── cloudwatch/          # Monitoring configuration

└── deployment/
    ├── production.yml       # Production docker-compose
    └── staging.yml          # Staging environment config
```

### 2. **Enhanced Model Serving (Future Enhancement)** 🔮

**Priority: MEDIUM** *(optional enhancement for better API performance)*

**Goal**: Add dedicated FastAPI service for high-performance model serving

**Current Status**: MLflow serving is operational, FastAPI would add:
- Better API performance and caching
- Advanced authentication and rate limiting
- Custom business logic integration
- OpenAPI documentation

**Future Implementation:**
```bash
src/api/                     # 🔮 Future FastAPI service
├── endpoints/               # API endpoints
├── models/                  # Request/response models
├── middleware/              # Authentication, logging
└── tests/                   # API testing
```

**Rationale**: The Streamlit application provides complete functionality for the current use case. FastAPI would be valuable for integrating with external systems or high-volume API usage.

### 3. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard (Future Enhancement)** 🔮

**Priority: LOW** *(current Streamlit app provides comprehensive monitoring)*

**Goal**: Enhanced business intelligence and advanced analytics

**Current Status**: Streamlit app includes monitoring, predictions, and insights. Advanced features could include:
- Historical trend analysis
- Business impact measurement
- Custom KPI dashboards
- Advanced reporting features

**Rationale**: Current Streamlit application meets primary requirements. Advanced analytics represent future business value-add capabilities.
