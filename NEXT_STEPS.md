### 4. **Hyperparameter Optimization (Future Enhancement)** 🔮

**Priority: FUTURE SCOPE** *(moved from Phase 3 for focused implementation)*

**Future Implementation Ideas:**
```bash
src/models/hyperparameter_tuning/  # 🔮 Future Enhancement
├── __init__.py
├── optuna_tuner.py               # 🔮 Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization
└── hyperopt_experiments.py      # 🔮 Advanced hyperparameter search

src/pipelines/
└── run_hyperopt_training.py     # 🔮 Prefect + Optuna integration flow
```

**Future Tasks:**
- [ ] 🔮 Add Optuna hyperparameter optimization integration
