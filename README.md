## 🚀 Quick Start

Get the MLOps platform running locally with Docker in under 10 minutes.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker & Docker Compose**: v2+ with compose plugin
- **Python 3.11**: Required for optimal compatibility
- **Git**: For repository cloning
- **Kaggle Account**: For CRM dataset access

### Step 1: Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/VRabinin/mlops-zoomcamp-project.git
cd mlops-zoomcamp-project

# Complete environment setup (Python venv + dependencies + directories)
make dev-setup

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 2: Configure Kaggle API

```bash
# Get API credentials from https://www.kaggle.com/account
# Download kaggle.json and place it:
mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
mv ~/Downloads/kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json

# Create environment file from template
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your Kaggle username and API key and adjust other variables if needed
```

### Step 3: Start Docker Services

```bash
# Start all MLOps infrastructure services
make application-start

# This starts:
# - PostgreSQL (MLflow backend)
# - MinIO (S3-compatible storage)
# - MLflow Server
# - Prefect Server

# Verify all services are running
make application-status
```

### Step 4: Run the Data Pipeline

```bash
#Deploy all pipeline parts to Prefect Server
make prefect-deploy

# Run the complete CRM data pipeline
make prefect-run

# This will:
# 1. Download CRM data from Kaggle (8,800+ records)
# 2. Validate data quality (0.93 score expected)
# 3. Engineer 23 ML features
# 4. Store results in MinIO S3 storage
```

### Step 5: Access the Platform

Open these services in your browser:

| Service | URL | Purpose |

| **Prefect UI** | http://localhost:4200 | Workflow orchestration dashboard |
| **MLflow UI** | http://localhost:5000 | Experiment tracking & model registry |
| **MinIO Console** | http://localhost:9001 | S3 storage management |
| **Streamlit App** | http://localhost:8501 | ML predictions interface |

**Default Credentials:**
- MinIO: `minioadmin` / `minioadmin`
- PostgreSQL: `mlops_user` / `mlops_password`

### Step 6: Explore the Features

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Code Quality & Pre-commit Hooks

**✅ Automated Code Quality**: This project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure consistent code quality:

```bash
# Pre-commit hooks are automatically installed with `make dev-setup`
# They run automatically before each commit to:
# - Format Python code with Black
# - Sort imports with isort
# - Run basic linting with flake8
# - Check YAML/JSON syntax
# - Remove trailing whitespace
# - Format Jupyter notebooks

# Manual pre-commit commands:
make precommit-run          # Run hooks on all files
make format                 # Format code manually
make lint                   # Run linting checks
make precommit-help         # Show all pre-commit options

# The hooks are configured to be developer-friendly:
# - Permissive linting rules to ease adoption
# - Automatic code formatting
# - Gradual quality improvement over time
```

### Daily Development Commands

```bash
# Start development environment with Prefect orchestration
make prefect-start      # Start Prefect server + agent (replaces dev-start)

# Alternative: Start individual services
make dev-start          # Start MLFlow + basic services
make prefect-server     # Start Prefect server only
make prefect-agent      # Start Prefect agent only

# Check project status
make status
make prefect-status-all # Enhanced status with Prefect info

# Run data pipeline (multiple options)
make data-pipeline              # Standalone execution
make data-pipeline-flow         # Prefect-orchestrated execution
make prefect-run-deployment     # Manual deployment trigger

# Deploy and manage Prefect workflows
make prefect-deploy-crm         # Deploy CRM flow to server
make prefect-deployments        # List all deployments
make prefect-flows             # Show recent flow runs

# Development and testing
make test               # Run test suite
make lint format        # Code quality checks
make precommit-run      # Run pre-commit hooks manually

# Monitoring and debugging

## 🤝 Contributing

This project uses pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality. When you run `make dev-setup`, pre-commit hooks are automatically installed and will run before each commit to:

- **Format code**: Black for Python formatting, isort for import sorting
- **Quality checks**: Flake8 linting with developer-friendly rules
- **File validation**: YAML/JSON syntax, trailing whitespace removal
- **Notebook formatting**: Black formatting for Jupyter notebooks

The hooks are configured to be permissive initially to ease adoption. See `docs/PRE_COMMIT_GUIDE.md` for detailed information.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Python Version Issues:**
```bash
# Check your Python version
python --version

# If not 3.11, install it:
brew install python@3.11  # macOS
# or download from python.org
```

**Kaggle API Issues:**
```bash
# Verify Kaggle setup
kaggle datasets list
# Should show available datasets

# If authentication fails:
# 1. Check ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json exists
# 2. Verify file permissions: chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
# 3. Check credentials are correct
```

**Docker Issues:**
```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker info

# Restart services if needed
docker compose down
docker compose up -d

# Check service logs
docker compose logs mlflow
docker compose logs postgres
```

**Port Conflicts:**
```bash
# Check what's using ports
lsof -i :5000  # MLFlow
lsof -i :4200  # Prefect
lsof -i :5432  # PostgreSQL
lsof -i :9000  # MinIO API
lsof -i :9001  # MinIO Console

# Kill processes if needed
sudo kill -9 <PID>
```

**MinIO S3 Storage Issues:**
```bash
# Check MinIO containers
docker ps | grep minio

# Check MinIO status
make minio-status

# List MinIO buckets
make minio-buckets

# Check MinIO logs
docker logs mlops-minio
docker logs mlops-minio-setup

# Access MinIO web UI
open http://localhost:9001
# Login: minioadmin / minioadmin

# Clear MinIO data if needed
make minio-clear-data
```

**Pre-commit Hook Issues:**
```bash
# Check if pre-commit hooks are installed
ls -la .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Reinstall pre-commit hooks if needed
make precommit-install

# Run hooks manually to test
make precommit-run

# Skip hooks temporarily (emergency only)
git commit --no-verify -m "message"

# Update hook versions
make precommit-update

# Show all pre-commit options
make precommit-help
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check service status**: `make status`
2. **View logs**: `docker compose logs <service-name>`
3. **Restart services**: `docker compose restart`
