# Pytest Fixtures Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

After the recent refactoring of the project code, several pytest fixtures and tests were broken due to changes in the codebase structure. Here's what was fixed:

### 1. Configuration Class Changes

**Problem**: Tests were trying to import `DataConfig` which no longer exists.

**Fix**: Updated imports and test code to use the new configuration structure:
- Changed `DataConfig` to `DataPathConfig`
- Updated test assertions to match new config structure (`config.data_path.raw` instead of `config.raw_data_path`)

### 2. StorageManager API Changes

**Problem**: Tests were using old dictionary-based configuration format and outdated API methods.

**Fix**: Updated all StorageManager tests to use the new Config object structure:
- Replaced dictionary configs with proper `Config` objects
- Updated API calls to match new method signatures
- Fixed path resolution logic to work with new data structure

### 3. CRMDataIngestion Changes

**Problem**: Tests were using old configuration format for the CRMDataIngestion class.

**Fix**: Updated tests to use new Config object structure:
- Updated initialization tests to use `Config` objects
- Fixed assertions to match new API structure

### 4. Test Structure Improvements

**Added**: New `conftest.py` file with useful fixtures:
- `temp_config`: Provides Config with temporary directories for isolated testing
- `sample_crm_dataframe`: Provides sample data for CRM-related tests
- `s3_config`: Provides S3/MinIO configuration for cloud storage tests

## Files Modified

1. **`tests/test_data_pipeline.py`**:
   - Fixed imports: `DataConfig` â†’ `DataPathConfig`
   - Updated config structure usage throughout
   - Fixed StorageManager and CRMDataIngestion test methods

2. **`tests/test_storage_manager.py`**:
   - Added missing imports
   - Updated all test classes to use new Config structure
   - Fixed S3 configuration tests
   - Updated path resolution and API method tests

3. **`tests/conftest.py`** (new):
   - Added shared pytest fixtures for better test organization
   - Provides temporary configuration and sample data fixtures

## Test Results

All tests are now passing:
- **38 tests total**
- **0 failures**
- **0 errors**

### Test Categories Fixed:
- Configuration management tests
- CRM data schema tests
- Storage manager functionality tests (both local and S3)
- CRM data ingestion tests
- Edge case and error handling tests

## Key Changes Made

1. **Import Fixes**: Updated all imports to match the refactored codebase
2. **Configuration Structure**: Migrated from dictionary-based to object-based configuration
3. **API Updates**: Updated test code to use new method signatures and return values
4. **Test Organization**: Added shared fixtures for better test isolation and reusability

## Benefits

1. **Test Reliability**: All tests now pass consistently
2. **Better Coverage**: Tests properly validate the refactored code structure
3. **Maintainability**: Shared fixtures reduce code duplication
4. **Isolation**: Temporary directories ensure tests don't interfere with each other

The pytest fixtures are now fully compatible with the refactored codebase and provide comprehensive test coverage for all major components.
